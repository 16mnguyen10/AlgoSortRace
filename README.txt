------------------------------------------------------------
Class number: 335-03
Project name/number: Project 2, Sort Race
Team name:Team A
Group Members: Michael Nguyen, Ian Nguyen, Keerthi Thummati, Ernest Lin,

------------------------------------------------------------
Intro
  This program displays 4 separate sorting algorithms side by side: Selection
  Gold's Pore, Merge, and Quick. It goes through steps through each algorithm 
  and then prints out the modified string until it finishes sorting.

  This is an example project using HTML, Javascript (JS), and P5.js
  which is a JS-adapted version of the Processing Language.  CF HTML and
  JS on the web (eg, Wikipedia).  More on P5 is at
  p5js.org/reference.and at github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki.

  P5 provides automated animation (via a user-built "draw" function),
  and GUI manipulation functions that are simpler than JS.

Zip Contents

  File README.txt.  This file.

  File sketch.html. Drag and drop this into a browser to
  run the sorting race.

  File p5.js. This is the P5 package.  It is loaded inside the html.

  File sort race.js; This contains the core code for the sorting race.  Defined
    in the draw() function are the 4 sorting algorithms.  It also includes several
    display functions and a swapCharacter and a rotateRightWard.  P5's setup() is run 
    once before page display. P5's draw() is run once per display frame, so you can 
    do animation. 
  
  File style.css is there for general formatting of the html file.

  File sort_race_screenshot.png for an example of what the html should look like.
  
  File run-time report.txt includes the report about the analysis of algorithms

Installation & Running

  1. Extract the .zip file into a folder.

  2.Drag the index HTML file, sketch.html, into a browser window.  The sorting race should    
    start.  You black rectangle in the center of the screen and titles for each of the
    various sorts.

Testing
  o- Following installation instruction, above, watched it run. See if the ant follows
     the same path as the png.

Features
  Displays four columns of sorting algorithms and shows each one executing step by step
  
Credits
  This project was coded by Team A.
  
  And, of course, thanks to the HTML and P5.js developers.
